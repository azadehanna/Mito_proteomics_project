Mitochondrial Proteomics Data Preprocessing_1
This repository contains the preprocessing workflow for mitochondrial proteomics data, with the goal of preparing the dataset for downstream statistical and bioinformatics analysis.

-File Description
pre_processing_filter.ipynb: Jupyter Notebook that outlines the preprocessing steps applied to the raw proteomics data (total_protein_1.csv).

-Workflow Overview
The preprocessing pipeline includes:
-Library Import & Setup
Utilizes Python libraries including pandas, numpy, matplotlib, seaborn, missingno, scikit-learn, statsmodels, and scipy.

-Data Loading
Reads the input file total_protein_1.csv, which contains the initial protein quantification matrix.

-Missing Data Inspection
Visualizes missing data patterns using missingno.
Applies K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN) imputation for missing value handling.

-Normalization & Scaling
Standardizes data using StandardScaler.
Dimensionality Reduction
Performs PCA and UMAP to visualize variance and potential batch effects.
-Statistical Testing
Conducts ANOVA using statsmodels.
Computes pairwise distances and hierarchical clustering for exploratory analysis.

-Visualization Techniques
PCA and UMAP plots for dimension reduction
Heatmaps and dendrograms for cluster visualization
Distribution plots for FDR and intensity values

-Requirements
Install the following packages:
pip install pandas numpy matplotlib seaborn missingno scikit-learn umap-learn statsmodels scipy
-Notes
Ensure the total_protein_1.csv file is in the same directory as the notebook or update the path accordingly.

This notebook is designed to be modular—each section can be reused or adapted for similar proteomics datasets.




Mitochondrial Proteomics Data Preprocessing_2
This repository provides a data processing pipeline for identifying and filtering mitochondrial proteins from normalized proteomics datasets using MitoCarta3.0 and UniProt annotations.

-Notebook:
Mito_process.ipynb: A Jupyter notebook that reads normalized proteomics data and integrates it with MitoCarta and UniProt information to filter for mitochondrial proteins and annotate them with gene and functional details.
- Purpose
This workflow is designed to:
Isolate mitochondrial proteins from proteomics data to figure out Mitochondrial proteins
Leverage MitoCarta 3.0 and UniProt for this annotation
Prepare a clean dataset for downstream analysis such as pathway enrichment, visualization to be sure all proteins belong to mitochondria with no contamination with other proteins

-Workflow Overview
1. Input Data
Normalized proteomics data (Final_Normalized.csv)
MitoCarta 3.0 gene list (MitoCarta_3.csv)
UniProt annotations (retrieved programmatically using UniProt API)

2. Libraries Used
pandas, matplotlib, requests, xml.etree.ElementTree
Ensure internet access for UniProt queries

3. Data Processing Steps
Load normalized expression matrix

Load MitoCarta and filter proteins that map to mitochondrial genes
Query UniProt to retrieve detailed protein annotations (function, localization, gene symbol)
Merge data from UniProt with the filtered protein list
Optional visualization and sanity checks

4. Output
A final dataframe of mitochondrial proteins annotated with:
Gene names
UniProt function
Localization data
Optionally saved as a .csv file for downstream analysis

-Requirements
Install dependencies:
pip install pandas matplotlib requests
-Example Use Cases for downstream analysis
Identifying mitochondrial proteins affected by treatments or disease states
Enriching mitochondrial-specific data for pathway analysis
Integrating mitochondrial expression data into multi-omics frameworks

-Notes
Ensure the input files (Final_Normalized.csv, MitoCarta_3.csv) are present in the working directory.
API Limits: The UniProt API has request limits—long protein lists will take time due to request pacing.Offline Mode: To avoid live UniProt queries, save results locally after the first run and re-load them in future sessions.
-Author Notes
This notebook is part of a larger mitochondrial proteomics analysis pipeline and can be adapted for both mouse and human datasets with minimal changes.
